# SpaceVizualizer
An easy-to-use tool to describe and visualize NASA factorial experiments
- You can simply test it online by using the following [link](https://ugn9eg-ammar-yasser.shinyapps.io/spaceviz/) and the example data uploaded ([From NASA OSDR](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/))
- Make sure in the first slot of each experiment to put an investigation file (.tsv); to convert to tsv file use our converter *investigation_extractor.py*

Alternatively, you can download the dashboard but make sure to download all packages (`install.packages()`)
