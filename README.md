# SpaceVisualizer
An easy-to-use tool to describe and visualize NASA factorial experiments
- You can simply test it online by using the following [link](https://ugn9eg-ammar-yasser.shinyapps.io/spaceviz/) and the example data uploaded ([From NASA OSDR](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/))
- Make sure in the first slot of each experiment to put an investigation file (`.tsv`); to convert to tsv file use our converter *investigation_extractor.py*
- After that update your metadata file for example; (the `.txt` files starts with `s_`) in the same boxes under the uploaded `.tsv` files
- Finally, enjoy our tool

Alternatively, you can download the dashboard but make sure to download all packages (`install.packages()`)
